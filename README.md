# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-System


This project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict multiple diseases (Parkinson's, Heart Disease, and Diabetes) using patient data. It utilizes various machine learning algorithms to classify patients into disease categories based on their medical data, assisting in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Features

- **Multiple Disease Prediction**: Predict Parkinson's, Heart Disease, and Diabetes based on various medical parameters.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and easy-to-use interface for inputting patient data.
- **Model Integration**: Utilizes pre-trained machine learning models for accurate predictions.
- **Visualizations**: Displays prediction results and insights using data visualization tools.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data processing, model training, and predictions.
- **Scikit-learn**: A Python library used for machine learning algorithms.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library used for handling datasets.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computing in Python.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- **Flask**: Web framework used for creating the web application interface.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For developing and testing machine learning models.
